# console.loggins()

A polyfill for the yet-unproposed standard.

You've got a debug message. We've got ASCII art.

Of Kenny Loggins.

Perfect.

## Usage

Download the `console.loggins.js` source file and include it as a script in your project:

```
<script src="/path/to/console.loggins.js">/* Buckle in... */</script>
```

In your custom JavaScript, issue `console.loggins('Any old string');` and Kenny Loggins will sing your message back to you in the console.
