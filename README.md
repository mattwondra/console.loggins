# console.loggins()

A polyfill for the yet-unproposed standard.

You've got a debug message. We've got ASCII art. Of Kenny Loggins. It's almost _too_ perfect.

## Usage

Download the `console.loggins.js` source file and include it as a script in your project:

```
<script src="/path/to/console.loggins.js"> /* Buckle in... */ </script>
```

In your custom JavaScript, issue `console.loggins('Any old string');` and Kenny Loggins will sing your message back to you in the console.

```

## FAQ

__Should I use console.loggins in production?__  
No. That's a terrible idea.

__What's the browser support like?__  
Let's say “modern browsers” and hope that covers it?

__How big is console.loggins gzipped?__  
Who cares? Come on people, it's a joke.

Why not drop me a line [@mattwondra](https://twitter.com/mattwondra) so I can help myself believe
that this novelty JavaScript plugin wasn't a _complete_ waste of my time.
